<p>Ensure that you declare the latest XQuery version (1.0-ml/3.0) at the top of each of your scripts (as opposed to declaring an older version - 0.9-ml - or not declaring a version at all). This ensures better compatibility of code after server upgrades and consistent behavior in XQuery processing.</p>
